            <h2>You can now power your home and equipment with the same battery packs.</h2>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Hyperion is creating battery packs that can be used to backup your home or building and also power your electric equipment such as golf carts, lawn equipment, bikes, scooters, and much more. 
            The packs will be swappable between all supported equipment and charge in a wall-mounted rack in your home or business.
            It will be the most flexible and modular BESS available.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>You can save money on your electricity bills, forget about grid outages, and achieve energy independence.
            Battery swapping eliminates charging downtime and uses DC solar power more efficiently. 
            You can also buy fewer batteries since you won't need to buy discrete batteries for your home and all your equipment.</p>

            <h2>Prototype Gallery</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We have built a prototype from off-the-shelf bike batteries and other hardware to demonstrate the concept of swapping batteries from powering a shed, to an ebike, to a golf cart, and recharging with solar panels.
                The prototype uses 4 battery packs which slide in and out of the rack horizontally.
                <br>
                <br>
                Do not try this at home. It looks simple, but requires a custom energy management system to prevent the batteries from discharging into each other and causing rapid overheating.
